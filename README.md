#Animated-WebVr
This Code is inspired from [animation-controls](https://rexraptor08.github.io/animation-controls/) Project,
Example of using aframe-extras animation-mixer component with json model and web-rtc's getUserMedia function.

The example shows how to smoothly transition between different animation states of a character model exported from blender as json. Animate the 3D model based on noise(air blow sound) from user microphone.

View the working example here: [Heroku link](https://animate-vr.herokuapp.com)

You can learn more about the animation-mixer created by [Don McCurdy](https://github.com/donmccurdy) at this link: [animation-mixer](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/loaders/README.md).

For help on learning how to get a workflow going in blender I found these two tutorials to be quite helpful.

[Arturo Paracuellos](https://github.com/arturitu) has a good tutorial on how to export from blender using the THREE exporter plugin. You can find his tutorial here: [Workflow: Animation from Blender to three.js](http://unboring.net/workflows/animation.html).

To learn how to create and import animation actions to your character see this great little tutorial: [Creating and Editing Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb152Qncn2s)
